## Background
Metro Manila recently faced the ["worst water fiasco in recent water history"](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/225953-what-we-know-explanation-manila-water-supply-crisis). Ultimately, the problem is supply shortage. The public prayed for rains to fill the dam but there's just another thing to consider: the turbidity of the water.

When the turbidity of the raw water gets to certain point that the treatment plants cannot treat it anymore, [water supply can be cut](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1044869). This leads me to my question, **if the turbidity can be predicted a day or week in advance, will it help the operations?**

## Datasets

### Turbidity
Due to the recent water shortage, Manila Water Company have been monitoring the turbidity of Ipo and La Mesa Dam hourly since March. My challenge is to get access to this and be given a clearance to use this outside of the company.

### Dam Levels
The daily dam levels are available [online](http://mwss.gov.ph/water-elevation/#) and can be extracted through web scraping.

### Weather
So far, there is no readily available open data of weather history and forecast from PAGASA but I can try to ask for it.
